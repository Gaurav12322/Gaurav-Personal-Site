        <h2>Information Abount Hacker :</h2>
        <p>A hacker is a person skilled in information technology who uses their technical knowledge to achieve a goal or overcome an
           obstacle, within a computerized system by non-standard means. Though the term hacker has become associated in popular culture
           with a security hacker – someone who utilizes their technical know-how of bugs or exploits to break into computer systems
           and access data which would otherwise be inaccessible to them – hacking can also be utilized by legitimate figures in legal
           situations. For example, law enforcement agencies sometimes use hacking techniques in order to collect evidence on
           criminals and other malicious actors. This could include using anonymity tools (such as a VPN, or the dark web) to mask
           their identities online, posing as criminals themselves. Likewise, covert world agencies can employ hacking techniques 
           in the legal conduct of their work. On the other hand, hacking and cyber-attacks are used extra- and illegally by law
           enforcement and security agencies (conducting warrantless activities), and employed by state actors as a weapon of 
           both legal and illegal. <br><br>A security hacker is someone who explores methods for breaching defenses and exploiting
           weaknesses in a computer system or network. Hackers may be motivated by a multitude of reasons, such as profit, protest, 
           information gathering, challenge, recreation, or evaluation of a system weaknesses to assist in formulating defenses against
           potential hackers. <br><br>Longstanding controversy surrounds the meaning of the term "hacker." In this controversy,
           scammers reclaim the term hacker, arguing that it refers simply to someone with an advanced understanding of computers
           and computer networks, and that cracker is the more appropriate term for those who break into computers, whether 
           computer criminals (black hats) or computer security experts (white hats). A 2014 article noted that "the black-hat 
           meaning still prevails among the general public. The subculture that has evolved around hackers is often referred 
           to as the "computer underground".</p>
